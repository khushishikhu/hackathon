# HooDog
##Track 1 – Full Stack Web Application

Woodog🐶 is an initiative to provide help to increasing stray animals by providing them food 🍞 and refuge 🏠 by connecting them with fellow helpful humans. On the application, two types of people can be registered 📥 one who can provide the location and condition of a nearby stray, and another who can provide information and arrange shelter 🏠 and food 🍞 for them.

It is a basically Next.js Project which is being built with the help of MongoDB as a database to collect all the Finder's information provided to the Dog's posts. the Loged in users are being taken care by the Github credentials with the Next.Auth.js
