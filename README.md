# HooDog

Woodog🐶 is an initiative to provide help to increasing stray animals by providing them food 🍞 and refuge 🏠 by connecting them with fellow helpful humans. On the application, two types of people can be registered 📥 one who can provide the location and condition of a nearby stray, and another who can provide information and arrange shelter 🏠 and food 🍞 for them.
